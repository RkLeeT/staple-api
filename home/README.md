## What is it?

**Staple API** is a lightweight GraphQL-based API for an easy management of **semantic knowledge graphs**, modeled and virtualized as linked data and structured by an RDF ontology. 


## What is it good for?

**Staple API** is intended as a simple, yet flexible, **data abstraction middleware**, which you can set up within minutes to power your web app with the ability to manage its data as fragments of a connected, semantic knowledge graph, using a standard GraphQL interface.
