## What is it?

**Staple API** is a lightweight GraphQL-based API for an easy management of **semantic knowledge graphs**, modeled and virtualized as linked data in the [schema.org data model](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html). 

## What is it good for?

It is intended as a simple, yet flexible, **data abstraction middleware**, which you can set up within minutes to power your web app with the ability to manage its data resources as fragments of a connected, semantic knowledge graph, using a standard GraphQL interface. 

## Key features

:heavy_check_mark: Automatic generation of GraphQL schema from an RDF ontology.

:heavy_check_mark: Automatic generation of resolvers for a default set of queries and mutations.

:heavy_check_mark: JSON-LD context included to support immediate JSON-to/from-graph conversions.

:heavy_check_mark: A connector to a MongoDB storage (other backends coming soon :exclamation:).

:heavy_check_mark: An in-memory graph database for rapid testing and prototyping.
